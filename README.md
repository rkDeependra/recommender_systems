# recommender_systems

Recommendation engines basically are data filtering tools that make use of algorithms and data to recommend the most relevant items to a particular user.

Or in simple terms, they are nothing but an automated form of a “shop counter guy”. You ask him for a product.

There are basically three important types of recommendation engines:

Collaborative filtering
Content-Based Filtering
Hybrid Recommendation Systems

we are in die-hard need of good recommender systems in our day to day life since life is too short to try out everything!
